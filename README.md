### Hi there, I am AndreyðŸ‘‹

My passion is development.

Ideas that help me to be a good developer:

- Know your user. If you don't understand what problem you solve, you'll solve the wrong one.
- Architecture is a key. If you manage complexity and dependencies and control boundaries, tests are easy to write.
- Make function small and names descriptive.
- Automate routine (Linters, CI).
- Fail is an opportunity to learn.
- Knowledge is power: learn new stuff, teach known stuff.
- Communication is a key you don't get far sitting in your cave.
- Leave code better than you found it. A small step every day can do a miracle.
- Be like a cat in a project, check every corner of the project, even deploy one.

I can teach Python and unittests. 
Can talk and share ideas on architecture, code organization, testing, Java, Kotlin,
refactoring, technical debt, best practices and databases, infrastructure, algorithms and data structures, git, processes.

I like doing new features and make broken things work.  

Fun fact: I have never posted a question on StackOverflow this is a too slow way to get an answer.

I know how to build and support and operate bicycles. The real one, not in code.
Do photography and traveling as a second hobby.
