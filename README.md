### Hi there, I am AndreyðŸ‘‹

My passion is development.

Ideas that help me to be a good developer:

- Know your user. If you don't understand what problem you solve, you'll solve the wrong one.
- Architecture is a key. If you manage complexity and dependencies and control boundaries, tests are easy to write.
- Make function small and names descriptive.
- Automate routine (Linters, CI).
- Fail is an opportunity to learn.
- Knowledge is power: learn new stuff, teach known stuff.
- Communication is a key you don't get far sitting in your cave.
- Leave code better than you found it. A small step every day can do a miracle.
- Be like a cat in a project, check every corner of the project, even deploy one.

I can [teach](students.md) Python and unittests. 
Can talk and share ideas on architecture, code organization, testing, Java, Kotlin,
refactoring, technical debt, best practices and databases, infrastructure, algorithms and data structures, git, processes.

I like doing new features and make broken things work.  

Fun fact: I have never posted a question on StackOverflow this is a too slow way to get an answer.

### My repositories
- Library to manage environment variables.  
  One day I will find a suitable project where it can be used and will publish it.

- Template for new Python projects. My set of linters and GitHub actions configured. 
  https://github.com/Cjkjvfnby/project_template

- Contribution to opensource project: Python code, CI, tools.

- Other: forks, study assignments, and presentations for lectures.

### Other me
- I know how to build, support, and operate bicycles. The real one, not in the code.
- I do photography and traveling as a second hobby.
