# For students (Python)

If you study IT you want to have a job. To get a job you need to pass an interview.
To pass an interview you need to code. To write simple code fluently you need to practice, practice and practice.

Here a couple of places you can go. All places have task description and testcases to validate your solution.

## Checkio https://py.checkio.org/
Pros:
  - It's fun.
  - Has solution in readable category

## Leetcode https://leetcode.com/
Pros:
   - Focused on algorithms and performance
   - More focused on interview preparation
Cons:
   - Most published solutions are bad in terms of code quality

# How to study
- Solve yourself
- Check discussions section for more solutions (3-5), 
  check different approaches (usually task have about 2 different approaches),
  understand other solutions (it might be hard), 
  read about libraries, algorithms and data structures used in solutions. 


Here is some easy tasks with my solution in Python to start with.
