## [Clean Code - Uncle Bob / Lesson 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM)
6 lessons with Uncle Bob. Almost all aspects of the software development covered.

## [Martin Fowler – What Does Tech Excellence Look Like? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avs70dZ3Vlk)

## [More Testable Code with the Hexagonal Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujb_O6myknY)
Nice explanation with SpringBoot and Java.

If you would like to start hexagonal architecture with SpringBoot,
this video and author github repository is a good starting point.

## [Verifying Microservice Integrations with Contract Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6x6XBDf9sQ)
Nice presentation to get basic idea how contract testing may look like.

## [LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)
How to write text to academia.

Reader matters. To attract the reader you need to bring value for him in your writting.
When you are at school/university, your readers are teachers. 
Your texts have a value for them only because they are paid to read your text. 
It's not the same as in the real word. 
Profound idea in thai video is that if text has no value that other things does not matter, is it persuasive or well-structured.
Lector goes to the details which should be taken in account, with examples.

There is a lot of drama in the lecture. It makes more interesting to watch it.

## [Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0)
Video about how to exploit the human mind to put more knowledge into it. Worth watching.
I eat, sleep, work, play, have fun, study in the same place, but if you are aware you can do it.
Part "Marty come to lay upon me" is absolutely about me, but I know how to say No!

## [Kevlin Henney — What we talk about when we talk about unit testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WWIeXmm4ec)
A good explanation of TTD phases (Write test that fails - > Specify what you want)
Nice explanation why developers should write tests themselves with real life examples.
Som funny facts: How compile and library terms were introduced.

## [Top To Down, Left To Right || James Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlgbPLvBs30)
This talk has a big quiz at the beginning and detailed explanation later.

## [David Beazley | Keynote: Built in Super Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyDLAutA88s)
Play with various collections.

## [Bret Victor The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)
А hilarious video by Bret Victor, he time traveled 40 years back and showed the whole bunch of opportunities that were open back then.
This video is started as a comedy and ends up touching deep problems.
My personal award for the best slide showing technique I have ever seen.

## [Procedural Programming: It’s Back? It Never Went Away - Kevlin Henney [ACCU 2018]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrY6xrWp3Gs)
The talk about history of programming. All good staff were invented back when. Procedural programming is not bad, just people who use it in wrong context complain about it. One of the best explanation of the Liskof substitution principle. 


## [Object Oriented Programming from scratch (four times) by Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8moWQ1561FY&t=2661s)
A nice talk that starts from the problem and leads to the solution. 
For times in a row. You can see how chaos is organized to the things 
that are widely used by programmers in the 21 century. 
You start using OOP at full power when you start coding the Python.

Section of QA is pretty intresting. 

Summary:  
Good code to read: [bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle), [collections](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/collections/__init__.py), [functools](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/functools.py)
Language to play a bit to change your way to code: Forth, APL, Haskel, Prolog (be careful they can damage your brain).
Advice: If you want to grow just don't get stuck in a routine.

## [Building Fault Tolerant Microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO33eMwXRs)
Adding fault tolerance step by step. Good explanation with examples why do you need it.

## [Егор Бугаенко — Не думайте о качестве, думайте о скорости](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFSSV1pdZTw)
Очень необычный докладчик, делит всё на чёрное и белое. Названия докладов выбирает так, чтобы привлечь внимание.

Взгляд на качество со стороны процессов. Нижняя планка качества в проекте походит на уровне автоматизации.
Если нет автоматизации, то перед вами открывается бесконечное дно 
и качество напрямую зависит от разработчиков и их квалификации.
А вложившись в процесс, качество можно поднять на достаточно высокий уровень.

Мне лично эта тема очень близка. 
Студенты с построенным мной процессом автоматизации проверок писали код намного аккуратней чем тот,
что я видел в реальных проектах.

Доклад с легким привкусом Джавы, но знание языка не требуется.
