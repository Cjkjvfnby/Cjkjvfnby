# David Beazley
Python core developer. Nice guy in person. 
Talk about Python internals, collections and concurency. A lot of talks about GIL. 

## [David Beazley | Keynote: Built in Super Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyDLAutA88s)
Play with various collections.

# Raymond Hettinger
Python core developer. Talk about Python in very simple language. This good starting point for learing Python.

## [Transforming Code Into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anrOzOapJ2E)
A lot of useful recipies

## [The Mental Game of Python - Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM)
Awesomne tutorial on how to werit code.

## [Preventing, Finding, and Fixing Bugs On a Time Budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARKbfWk4Xyw)
Thee are alot of great tool that could help you. I use the most of them.

## [Pro tips for writing great unit tests - Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSIsyMd2-RY)
There is a part when Raymond takes code written in a simple style and converts this to idiomatic Python.  A couple of lines of code with variables are converted to a single line, and this single line is super simple and readable.

It is something that I use often, and I see that people who come from other languages like C++, Java, and Go are not aware of that.  Python could be a very expressive and readable language if you use it to write. 

## [Modern Dictionaries by Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8&t=2639s)
All you need to know about dicts.

## [Python's Class Development Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg&t=1505s)

How inheritance works.

## [Object Oriented Programming from scratch (four times) by Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8moWQ1561FY&t=2661s)
A nice talk that starts from the problem and leads to the solution. 
For times in a row. You can see how chaos is organized to the things 
that are widely used by programmers in the 21 century. 
You start using OOP at full power when you start coding the Python.

Section of QA is pretty intresting. 

Summary:  
Good code to read: [bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle), [collections](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/collections/__init__.py), [functools](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/functools.py)
Language to play a bit to change your way to code: Forth, APL, Haskel, Prolog (be careful they can damage your brain).
Advice: If you want to grow just don't get stuck in a routine.

## [Structural Pattern Matching in the Real World - Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTvwxXL37XI)
When I'll decide to use it, I'll reworth this video.

# James Powell
Good talks about Python and Pandas internals. 

## [Top To Down, Left To Right || James Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlgbPLvBs30)
This talk has a big quiz about how Python works at the beginning and detailed explanation later.

## [James Powell - Furious & Fast Python 7: Writing Fast Python Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix04KpZiUA8)
If you want to do microotimization of you code check this talk.

## [So You Wanna Be a Pandas Expert? (Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjq3QOxl9Ok)
Take a cup of tea, but don't expect that you could relax during this video.

# Kevlin Henney
Talks about the history, concepts and architecture.

## [Kevlin Henney — What we talk about when we talk about unit testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WWIeXmm4ec)
A good explanation of TTD phases (Write test that fails - > Specify what you want)
Nice explanation why developers should write tests themselves with real life examples.
Some funny facts about how compile and library terms were introduced.

## [Procedural Programming: It’s Back? It Never Went Away - Kevlin Henney [ACCU 2018]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrY6xrWp3Gs)
The talk about history of programming. All good staff were invented back when. Procedural programming is not bad, just people who use it in wrong context complain about it. One of the best explanation of the Liskof substitution principle. 

## Article: [Dead Code Must Be Removed](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/dead-code/)

# More authors
Talks from different eople I found useful.

## [Clean Code - Uncle Bob / Lesson 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM)
6 lessons with Uncle Bob. Almost all aspects of the software development covered.

## [Martin Fowler – What Does Tech Excellence Look Like? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avs70dZ3Vlk)

## [More Testable Code with the Hexagonal Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujb_O6myknY)
Nice explanation with SpringBoot and Java.

If you would like to start hexagonal architecture with SpringBoot,
this video and author github repository is a good starting point.

## [Verifying Microservice Integrations with Contract Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6x6XBDf9sQ)
Nice presentation to get basic idea how contract testing may look like.

## [LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)
How to write text to academia.

Reader matters. To attract the reader you need to bring value for him in your writting.
When you are at school/university, your readers are teachers. 
Your texts have a value for them only because they are paid to read your text. 
It's not the same as in the real word. 
Profound idea in thai video is that if text has no value that other things does not matter, is it persuasive or well-structured.
Lector goes to the details which should be taken in account, with examples.

There is a lot of drama in the lecture. It makes more interesting to watch it.

## [Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0)
Video about how to exploit the human mind to put more knowledge into it. Worth watching.
I eat, sleep, work, play, have fun, study in the same place, but if you are aware you can do it.
Part "Marty come to lay upon me" is absolutely about me, but I know how to say No!

## [Bret Victor The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)
А hilarious video by Bret Victor, he time traveled 40 years back and showed the whole bunch of opportunities that were open back then.
This video is started as a comedy and ends up touching deep problems.
My personal award for the best slide showing technique I have ever seen.

## [Building Fault Tolerant Microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO33eMwXRs)
Adding fault tolerance step by step. Good explanation with examples why do you need it.

## [Agile Book Club: Refactoring (with Martin Fowler)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVla5U5iP8E)
Things Martin says about refactoring is very close for me.

- The good way to understand code is to refactor it. You might not end up with PR, but you will get knowledge.
- Refactoring should be part of development. Otherwise it will rot in backlog.
- If something did not work, revert and start in smaller steps.

## [Егор Бугаенко — Не думайте о качестве, думайте о скорости](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFSSV1pdZTw)
Очень необычный докладчик, делит всё на чёрное и белое. Названия докладов выбирает так, чтобы привлечь внимание.

Взгляд на качество со стороны процессов. Нижняя планка качества в проекте походит на уровне автоматизации.
Если нет автоматизации, то перед вами открывается бесконечное дно 
и качество напрямую зависит от разработчиков и их квалификации.
А вложившись в процесс, качество можно поднять на достаточно высокий уровень.

Мне лично эта тема очень близка. 
Студенты с построенным мной процессом автоматизации проверок писали код намного аккуратней чем тот,
что я видел в реальных проектах.

Доклад с легким привкусом Джавы, но знание языка не требуется.
