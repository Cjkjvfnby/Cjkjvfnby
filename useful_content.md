## [LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)
How to write text to academia.

Reader matters. To attract the reader you need to bring value for him in your writting.
When you are at school/university, your readers are teachers. 
Your texts have a value for them only because they are paid to read your text. 
It's not the same as in the real word. 
Profound idea in thai video is that if text has no value that other things does not matter, is it persuasive or well-structured.
Lector goes to the details which should be taken in account, with examples.

There is a lot of drama in the lecture. It makes more interesting to watch it.
